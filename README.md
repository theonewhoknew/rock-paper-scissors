# rock-paper-scissors

Made a little game of rock, paper, scissors.

The user is asked for one choice, and five rounds are played. In the end, the
console states the winner or if there's a draw.

If the user input was wrong or empty, he/she is asked again and the round 
is not counted towards the five.
